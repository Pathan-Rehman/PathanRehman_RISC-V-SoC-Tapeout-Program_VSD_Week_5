OpenROAD is an open-source, fully automated RTL-to-GDSII flow for digital integrated circuit (IC) design. It supports synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and final layout generation. OpenROAD enables rapid design iterations, making it ideal for academic research and industry prototyping.
