OpenROAD is an open-source, fully automated **RTL-to-GDSII** toolchain for **digital IC (Integrated Circuit) design**. It offers an end-to-end physical design flow — from register-transfer level (RTL) synthesis to final layout (GDSII) output — supporting synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and layout generation. Its modular, scriptable, and GUI-supported environment makes it suitable for both **academic research** and **industrial prototyping**.

### Installation Overview

The installation and setup of OpenROAD are structured into several well-defined steps:

- **Step 1 – Install Prerequisites:**  
  Update your system and install required build tools and libraries such as *CMake, Clang, G++, Python3, Boost, SWIG, Tcl*, and others.

- **Step 2 – Clone Repositories:**  
  Obtain the OpenROAD-flow-scripts Git repository (which wraps tools like Yosys and OpenROAD) by cloning it recursively.

- **Step 3 – Run Setup Script:**  
  Execute the `setup.sh` script to download, configure, and install all third-party dependencies, including Boost, Abseil, and SWIG.

- **Step 4 – Build OpenROAD Locally:**  
  Use the automated `build_openroad.sh --local` command to compile OpenROAD. Optionally disable tests to speed up builds.

- **Step 5 – Verify Installation:**  
  Source the environment file (`source ./env.sh`) and verify the installation of OpenROAD, Yosys, and Verilator using their `--version` and `-help` options.

- **Step 6 – Run the OpenROAD Flow:**  
  Enter the `flow` directory and execute `make` to run the standard flow from RTL to GDSII.

- **Step 7 – Launch GUI:**  
  Start the graphical interface with `make gui_final` to visualize physical layouts and analyze design results.

Once installed, OpenROAD gives access to the full flow and GUI-based visualization capabilities for physical design exploration.

### Directory Structure and File Organization

The **OpenROAD-flow-scripts** repository is organized for modular functionality:

```plaintext
OpenROAD-flow-scripts/
├── docker/       -> Docker setup and run scripts
├── docs/         -> Documentation and references
├── flow/         -> RTL-to-GDSII flow automation files

├── tools/        -> Core design tools required for RTL-to-GDS flow
├── etc/          -> Environment and dependency setup scripts
├── setup_env.sh  -> Master environment configuration script
```

Inside the **flow** directory:

```plaintext
flow/
├── design/       -> Predefined RTL-to-GDSII design examples
├── makefile      -> Flow automation driver
├── platform/     -> Technology-specific libraries, LEFs, and GDS files

### Floorplanning and Placement Features

OpenROAD supports interactive and script-driven **floorplanning**, **pin placement**, and **macro/standard cell placement** operations via GUI and Tcl scripting.

#### Floorplan Initialization
You can initialize floorplans by specifying:
- **Core and die area dimensions**, or  
- **Core utilization and aspect ratio.**

Commands like `initialize_floorplan` define these parameters, while `.tcl` scripts automate loading LEF, liberty, and Verilog files, linking design, and generating DEF outputs.

#### Example Floorplan Methods
- **By core and die area:** Specifies exact coordinates for die and core boundaries.
- **By core utilization:** Uses utilization, aspect ratio, and core spacing values to compute area distribution automatically.

Both methods visualize results through OpenROAD’s GUI with commands:
```bash
openroad -gui
source init_floorplan1.tcl
```

***

### IO Pin Placement
Pin placement scripts (`place_pin4.tcl`) position pins along die boundaries to minimize wirelength. Pins are assigned to metal layers with defined coordinates and sizes, and final layouts are reviewed using:
```bash
openroad -gui
source place_pin4.tcl
```
This process ensures optimal routing and signal accessibility.

***

### Macro and Standard Cell Placement
OpenROAD enables **global placement** for macros and standard cells to achieve efficient area usage and timing optimization. Placement density directly affects core spreading and timing results. Scripts like `macro01.tcl` load LEF/DEF files, run placement, and generate results displayed in GUI.

Command example:
```bash
openroad -gui
source macro01.tcl
```

You can then analyze HPWL (Half-Perimeter Wire Length), placement efficiency, and physical distribution of standard cells and macros.

### Key Takeaways

- **OpenROAD** is a robust open-source alternative to commercial physical design tools.  
- The **OpenROAD-flow-scripts** package automates the RTL-to-GDS flow using open-source tools (Yosys, Verilator, etc.).  
- The platform supports both command-line automation and **interactive GUI** exploration.  
- It provides ready-made examples for **Nangate45** and **FreePDK45** process nodes.  
- Ideal for researchers, students, and engineers aiming to learn or prototype full digital IC layouts efficiently.
